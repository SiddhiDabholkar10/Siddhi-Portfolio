Developed a scalable .NET Core web application with Angular for the front end, designed to optimize the distribution and transaction processes for handcrafted artifacts, creating a direct marketplace for rural businesses. Implemented MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to improve code maintainability, enhance the separation of concerns, and facilitate easier debugging and updates over time.
