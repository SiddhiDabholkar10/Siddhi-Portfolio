Developed a compiler for the Bluejay programming language using C.Implemented lexical analysis using Flex to tokenize source code. Created syntax analysis using Yacc to parse token sequences. Performed semantic symbol resolution and type analysis leading to abstract syntax tree creation, followed by an intermediate representation. Implemented code generation to translate Bluejay code into executable MIPS instructions.
