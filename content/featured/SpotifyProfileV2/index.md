Built an interactive analytics website to explore NYC Department of Buildings filings at scale, turning raw permit data into an explorable, user-friendly dashboard.
Generated and visualized text embeddings for filing/work descriptions to surface thematic clusters and similarity patterns, comparing dimensionality-reduction choices (e.g., PCA vs UMAP) for clarity and interpretability.
Implemented coordinated, linked visualizations (scatter + filters/brush selections + detail views) so users can drill from citywide trends down to specific subsets quickly.
Designed a clean data pipeline to preprocess, sample, and export embedding + metadata tables optimized for fast client-side rendering and smooth interactions.
